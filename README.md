Wounded Healer
==============

Wounded Healer is the working title for an independent feature film.
The film is in active development in 2018.

The film's setting is a therapist's office.
Patients share their stories and deal, each in a different way, with traumatic experiences.
The story line is in development.
One direction it can take is focus on the therapist who--while helping others process their experiences--finds the strength to deal with his or her own past.
Another direction is making the therapist a foil for other characters, perhaps a family with secrets and denial; in this case, unraveling the lies leads to integration and healing.


This project uses Fountain(http://fountain.io), a plain-text format for screenplays.
