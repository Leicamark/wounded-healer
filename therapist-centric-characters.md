WOUNDED HEALER (therapist centric version)
==============

A therapist helps her patients resolve traumas. But when a patient's story strikes too close to home, who can she turn to for support?


CHARACTER ARCS
==============

Theresa (or Thomas, depending on casting) the therapist: insightful and effective, but initially aloof.
Theresa insists on maintaining a distance from her patients, as a way to avoid bringing her issues into her patents' therapy.
As the story unfolds, Theresa comes to deal with some of her own deepest issues.
Theresa finds that allowing herself to be vulnerable makes her much more effective--in her therapeutic relationships as well as her personal life.

1) **Dan** the divorce, 48 and
2) **Diana** the divorcee, 43: a divorced couple fighting over the custody of their children.
Their stories differ so much, it takes Theresa half-way through the film to realize they are talking about each other.
Once she realizes she is treating two people who are in a relationship, she terminates therapy with both and refers them to different colleagues.
Theresa cannot remain impartial and objective having heard so much about these patients from biased parties.

3) **Len** the lonely heart, 26 and
4) **Lana** 25: two lonely twenty-somethings looking for companionship.
They have different stories and different backgrounds, but similar presentations.
Both think themselves unworthy of love.
As each examine the origins of their worldviews, each report developing romantic relationships.
One day they show up to therapy together.
They have figured out that the same therapist is treating them.
Therapy cannot continue, but that's OK: Len and Lana got what they wanted out of it.
Their healthy relationship is testament to their success in rebuilding themselves.

5) **Amanda**: the codependent alcoholic, 46.
Her third marriage is falling apart.
In the course of her therapy, it comes out that all three of her husbands are alcoholics, as was her father.
The marriage cannot be saved, but Amanda has the choice about continuing in co-dependent relationships.

6) **George** the gambler, 53.
Gambling provides excitement in George's life.
Primary adrenaline rush of winning and losing is subordinate to the much more potent excitement of arguing with his wife about it.
Therapy brings up similar patterns of playing to lose in George's gambling--and his family life.
He reproaches himself for losing a game by inexplicably revealing his hand to an opponent.
He reproaches himself for getting into a fight with his wife after inexplicably revealing his gambling losses to her.

7) **Walt**: the workaholic, 42.
Walt presents with complaints about his family's financial demands on him and simultaneous lack of support for his career.
In the course of his treatment, Walt comes to see his work as a way for him to "divorce" his wife while maintaining the formality of marriage.

7) **Ivy**: 29, very close to her mother.
Ivy presents with complaints about her father and the most recent boyfriend.
Her complaints are vague and implicit.
While she reports no outright abuse, Ivy complains that men are unreliable and always try to take advantage of her.
Ivy grew is devoted to her divorced mother, the one beacon of light in Ivy's life.

9) **Ben**: 38, fighting a losing battle for his father's approval.
A successful entrepreneur, loving father of three and a devoted husband, Ben suffers frequent bouts of depression.
It comes out that these episodes invariably occur after contact with his father.

10) **Gina**: 23, her father's drinking buddy since age 14.
Cannot find stable romantic relationships or employment.
Gina is Lana's friend.
Their relationship suffers as Lana's self-image improves.
Lana refers Gina to Theresa in the hope that she can help her, too.
Gina is unwilling to do the work, is late to sessions and eventually terminates therapy, drops her relationship with Lana and goes back to drinking with her father.
Theresa's one failure in the film.

11) **Patrick**: 68, his adult daughters don't talk to him and won't let him see his grand kids.
Despite his age, Patrick is Theresa's most profound success in the film.
He travels the longest distance, and is willing to probe the deepest, most painful issues.
Although more of his life is behind than ahead of him, the therapeutic experience transforms him, his relationships and his view of his past.
